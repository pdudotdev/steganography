## 🔍 Overview

**DHushCP** is a Linux tool designed to facilitate **secure covert wireless communication** between two parties - an Initiator and a Responder - using standard **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** packets. 

**DHushCP** utilizes principles of **network steganography** by embedding encrypted messages within DHCP protocol fields that are not commonly inspected, such as Options 224, 225, 226. 

By inserting cryptographic elements within unused DHCP options, **DHushCP** enables hidden message exchanges outside existing network infrastructures without raising suspicion.

🍀 **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

### 💬 TLDR; DHushCP and Steganography
**Steganography** refers to hiding secrets in plain sight, and **DHushCP** does this two-fold:

- **It hides an encrypted message sent from A to B in an unused DHCP option field.**
  - **DHushCP** doesn't require the two hosts to route their communication through a specific network, access point or centralized app. By using plain DHCP Discover packets, the communication blends into normal traffic. Although the messages are **fully encrypted** back and forth between the two hosts, it is advisable to keep a **low number** of message exchanges per session, so that the amount of Discover packets being sent by the hosts doesn't raise any eyebrows. See the **Use Case** below for an example.
- **It uses only DHCP Discover packets to communicate the keys and messages.**
  - At first, the use of **DHCP Discover** packets might seem strange, due to the broadcast nature of these packets. However, this obfuscates the **DHushCP** communication even more compared to even the first iteration of **DHushCP** where the two hosts were actually performing a complete *Discover - Offer - Request - Ack* sequence that was hiding the message exchange. By using DHCP Discover packets only, **DHushCP** is now stealthier since no rogue DHCP server activity can be detected by a sniffer.
- **Reliability of using DHCP Discover messages for the communication flow.**
  - For the sake of blending our DHCP Discover traffic into the overall traffic, keep in mind that **communication via DHushCP will not always be 100% reliable**. Since we're using broadcast messages over Wi-Fi, there's always a chance that packets can be lost due to network congestion, wireless interference, or other factors. Message retries are planned for **future versions**.

## 🕵️ **Example Use Case for DHushCP**

#### **Scenario: Covert Communication in a Public Space**

Imagine a scenario where two individuals (Alice and Bob) need to communicate covertly while being in a public space, such as a coffee shop. 

They both arrive separately and sit at different tables, appearing to be independent customers. They do not connect to the public Wi-Fi network, but their laptops are within wireless range of each other.

#### **Problem**
Alice and Bob need to exchange a crucial message without using any messaging app, or creating any obvious network link or visible ad-hoc connection that could attract attention and be easily detected by anyone monitoring the network.

🔴 **Prerequisites:**
- Prior to their arrival, Alice and Bob **should already know** the DHUSHCP_ID they're going to use *and* who's going to run the **Initiator** and the **Responder**, respectively.
- They ensure that the DHUSHCP_ID is communicated **securely** between them before initiating the communication. Use a strong, unpredictable identifier (e.g. `n1c3_w3ath3r_eh?`).

#### **Solution: Using DHushCP for Covert Communication**

1. **Step 1: Bob Starts the DHushCP Responder**
   - Bob runs the **DHushCP** Responder script on his laptop, listening for a Discover packet from Alice.
   - His Responder listens for DHCP Discover packets that contain the identifier (DHUSHCP_ID, option 224) set with **--id DHUSHCP_ID**.
   - This ensures that his Responder only responds to legitimate **DHushCP** Initiator packets and ignores other DHCP traffic.

2. **Step 2: Alice Starts the DHushCP Initiator**
   - Alice runs the **DHushCP** Initiator on her laptop, with the same value for **--id DHUSHCP_ID**.
   - Her Initiator sends a DHCP Discover packet that contains her public ECC key, along with the DHUSHCP_ID (option 224) and a unique session ID (option 225).
   - This packet is **broadcast** in the local wireless network range.

3. **Step 3: Key Exchange and Secure Communication**
   - **Responder**:
     - Receives Alice's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts the session ID and reassembles Alice's public ECC key.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public ECC key, the DHUSHCP_ID, and the extracted session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet.
   
   - **Initiator**:
     - Receives the Responder's DHCP Discover packet.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Derives the shared AES key using her private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message (e.g., "Meet at the corner at 2 PM").
     - Encrypts the message using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message to the Responder.

4. **Step 4: Receiving and Responding to Messages**
   - **Responder**:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from Alice.
     - Decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted message to Bob.
     - Prompts Bob to input a reply (e.g., "Understood. See you there.").
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply back to Alice.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Initiator**:
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing Bob's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - Displays the decrypted reply message to Alice.
     - Upon request, performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs, and resetting the terminal.

#### **Why This Setup Is Effective**
- The entire exchange happens within **standard DHCP Discover packets**, blending into regular network traffic.
- There is no centralized app or devices, **no visible Wi-Fi connection** or direct link between Alice and Bob.
- After the communication ends, both laptops **securely delete** the ECC keys, system logs and clear the terminal.
- Useful when Alice and Bob want to avoid suspicion and keep their presence discreet while **exchanging critical information**.

#### **Additional Recommendation**
- Prior to running the Initiator or the Responder, **disable shell history** using `set +o history`, then enable it when the communication is ended using `set -o history`.

### 🧮 **Available Message Space Calculation**

- **Total Usable Space In DHCP Option:** 255 bytes
- **AES-GCM Encryption Overhead (Nonce):** 12 bytes
- **AES-GCM Encryption Overhead (AuthTag):** 16 bytes
- **SHA-256 Checksum Size:** 32 bytes
- **Available Message Space:** 255 bytes - 60 bytes = **195 bytes**

**NOTE!** The current limit for messages is **100 characters**.

## 🔐 **Encryption and Hashing Algorithms**

### Reasons for Choosing the Encryption and Hashing Algorithms

DHushCP utilizes a combination of advanced cryptographic algorithms to ensure secure and covert communication over local networks. The chosen algorithms are selected based on their security strength, efficiency, and suitability for embedding within DHCP packets.

#### 1. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)

- **Efficiency**: ECC offers equivalent security to traditional algorithms like RSA but with smaller key sizes. This results in faster computations and reduced overhead, which is essential when embedding data within the limited space of DHCP packets.
- **Security**: The `SECP384R1` elliptic curve used in DHushCP provides robust security against modern cryptographic attacks.
- **Key Exchange**: ECC enables secure key exchange through the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH) algorithm, allowing both parties to establish a shared secret without transmitting the secret itself over the network.

#### 2. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in Galois/Counter Mode (GCM)

- **Confidentiality and Integrity**: AES-GCM provides both encryption (confidentiality) and authentication (integrity) in a single, efficient step. It ensures that the message remains confidential and detects any tampering.
- **Performance**: AES is widely adopted and optimized in hardware and software, offering excellent performance for encrypting data.
- **Security**: GCM mode is resistant to various cryptographic attacks and, when used correctly with a unique nonce, provides strong security guarantees.

#### 3. HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand Key Derivation Function (HKDF)

- **Key Derivation**: HKDF is used to derive a strong symmetric encryption key from the shared secret established via ECDH. It ensures the derived key is suitable for encryption purposes.
- **Standardization**: HKDF is a standardized method for key derivation in cryptographic protocols, providing interoperability and security.

#### 4. Secure Hash Algorithm 256 (SHA-256)

- **Integrity Verification**: SHA-256 generates a cryptographic hash of the message, which is used to verify that the message has not been altered during transmission.
- **Collision Resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to find two different messages that produce the same hash, ensuring the uniqueness and integrity of the message.

### How Each Encryption/Hashing Operation Secures Communication

#### 1. Key Exchange and Shared Secret Derivation

- **ECC Key Pair Generation**: Both the Initiator and Responder generate their own ECC key pairs (private and public keys) using the `SECP384R1` curve.

  ```python
  private_key = ec.generate_private_key(ec.SECP384R1())
  public_key = private_key.public_key()
  ```

- **Public Key Exchange**: The parties exchange their public keys embedded within DHCP Discover packets using custom DHCP options.

- **Shared Secret Derivation**: Each party uses their private key and the other's public key to compute a shared secret via the ECDH algorithm.

  ```python
  shared_secret = private_key.exchange(ec.ECDH(), peer_public_key)
  ```

- **AES Key Derivation with HKDF**: The shared secret is passed through HKDF to derive a symmetric AES-256 key for encrypting and decrypting messages.

  ```python
  derived_key = HKDF(
      algorithm=hashes.SHA256(),
      length=32,
      salt=None,
      info=b'DHushCP-SharedKey',
  ).derive(shared_secret)
  ```

#### 2. Message Encryption Process

- **Plaintext Preparation**: The sender prepares the plaintext message to be sent.

- **Checksum Calculation with SHA-256**: A SHA-256 checksum (hash) of the plaintext is computed and appended to the message. This checksum will be used by the recipient to verify the integrity of the message.

  ```python
  digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
  digest.update(plaintext.encode())
  checksum = digest.finalize()
  ```

- **Nonce Generation**: A unique 12-byte nonce is generated for use with AES-GCM encryption. The nonce ensures that each encryption operation is unique, which is critical for the security of GCM mode.

  ```python
  nonce = os.urandom(12)
  ```

- **AES-GCM Encryption**: The plaintext message is encrypted using AES-256 in GCM mode with the derived symmetric key and the generated nonce.

  ```python
  aesgcm = AESGCM(aes_key)
  ciphertext = aesgcm.encrypt(nonce, plaintext.encode(), None)
  ```

- **Encrypted Package Creation**: The nonce, ciphertext, and checksum are combined into a single package ready for transmission.

  ```python
  encrypted_package = nonce + ciphertext + checksum
  ```

#### 3. Message Transmission

- **Embedding in DHCP Packets**: The encrypted package is embedded into DHCP Discover packets using a custom DHCP option (option 226). This allows the message to be transmitted over the network covertly, blending in with regular DHCP traffic.

  ```python
  options = [(DATA_OPTION, encrypted_package)]
  packet = create_dhcp_discover(session_id, dhushcp_id, options)
  send_dhcp_discover(packet, iface)
  ```

#### 4. Message Decryption Process

- **Packet Reception**: The recipient detects the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message.

- **Extraction of Encrypted Package**: The encrypted package is extracted from the DHCP options.

- **Nonce and Ciphertext Separation**: The nonce and ciphertext are separated from the received package.

  ```python
  nonce = encrypted_package[:12]
  ciphertext = encrypted_package[12:-32]
  received_checksum = encrypted_package[-32:]
  ```

- **AES-GCM Decryption**: Using the shared symmetric key and the nonce, the recipient decrypts the ciphertext to retrieve the plaintext message.

  ```python
  plaintext_bytes = aesgcm.decrypt(nonce, ciphertext, None)
  plaintext = plaintext_bytes.decode()
  ```

- **Checksum Verification**: The recipient computes the SHA-256 checksum of the decrypted plaintext and compares it to the received checksum to verify that the message has not been altered.

  ```python
  digest = hashes.Hash(hashes.SHA256())
  digest.update(plaintext.encode())
  calculated_checksum = digest.finalize()

  if calculated_checksum != received_checksum:
      print("Checksum verification failed!")
      return None
  ```

- **Plaintext Retrieval**: If the checksum matches, the recipient accepts the message as authentic and unaltered.

#### 5. Security Benefits

- **Confidentiality**: AES-256 encryption ensures that only parties with the correct symmetric key can decrypt the messages, keeping the content confidential.

- **Integrity**: The use of AES-GCM's authentication and an additional SHA-256 checksum ensures that any tampering with the message during transmission is detectable.

- **Authentication**: Since the shared key is derived from the ECDH key exchange using private keys, only the intended parties can compute the shared secret, authenticating each other.

- **Replay Protection**: The use of unique nonces for each message prevents replay attacks, as the same nonce cannot be reused without detection.

- **Stealth**: Embedding encrypted messages within DHCP Discover packets makes the communication less noticeable to network monitoring systems, as it appears as regular network traffic.

By combining these encryption and hashing algorithms, DHushCP provides a secure communication channel that is both confidential and resilient against common network attacks, all while maintaining a low profile within standard network operations.
