## 🔍 Overview

**DHushCP** is a Linux tool designed to facilitate **secure covert wireless communication** between two parties - an Initiator and a Responder - using standard **DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)** packets. 

**DHushCP-n** is a Linux-based, secure communication tool built on top of **DHushCP**. This version introduces **nested text steganography**, enhancing **DHushCP**'s capabilities by embedding covert messages within cover texts using zero-width characters.

⚠️ **NOTE:** Read all about **DHushCP**'s features and functionality [**HERE**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/3.%20DHushCP/README.md).

🍀 **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

## 🚀 DHushCP-n vs. DHushCP

The original **DHushCP** secures the key and message exchange between the **Initiator** and the **Responder** by embedding the encrypted message in Option 226 of DHCP Discover packets.

### Benefits

With the original **DHushCP**, following the ECC-based key exchange the **plaintext message** entered by the user is:
- Encrypted using the shared **AES** key with **AES-GCM** with a **SHA-256** checksum appended
- Obfuscated using **Network Steganography** principles inside **DHCP Option 226**

***NEW!*** Now **DHushCP-n** adds yet another layer of obfuscation by using **Text Steganography**.<br /><br />
Therefore, with **DHushCP-n** the **plaintext message** entered by the user is:
- Embeded into a predefined 8-character `cover_text` string using zero-width characters
- Encrypted using the shared **AES** key with **AES-GCM** with a **SHA-256** checksum appended
- Obfuscated using **Network Steganography** principles inside **DHCP Option 226**

### Limitations 

Unlike the original **DHushCP**, the **DHushCP-n** version comes with some limitations:
- **Limited Per-Packet Capacity:** With an 8-character cover text, only 15 characters (secret message) can be embedded per DHCP Discover packet. Transmitting longer messages requires sending multiple packets, which may be noticeable under certain network conditions.
- **Potential Stripping by Systems:** Some systems, applications, or network devices might inadvertently strip or alter zero-width characters, disrupting message integrity or making embedded messages inaccessible.

## 🖥️ System Requirements

- **Operating System:** Linux-based systems (e.g., Ubuntu, Debian, Kali)
  - Latest release thoroughly tested and functional on **Ubuntu 24.04**.
- **Python Version:** Python 3.8 or higher
- **Dependencies:**
  - `scapy` for packet crafting and sniffing
  - `cryptography` for ECC encryption and checksum generation
- **Privileges:** Root or sudo access to send and receive DHCP packets
- **Network Interface:** Active wireless interface in UP state

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:** Use the commands below in your Linux terminal.
   ```bash
   mkdir dhushcpn
   cd dhushcpn
   python3 -m venv .dhushcpn
   source .dhushcpn/bin/activate
   git clone https://github.com/pdudotdev/DHushCP-n.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:** Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed. Then, install the required Python packages.
   ```bash
   pip install scapy cryptography colorama prompt-toolkit
   ```

3. **Configure Wireless Interface:** Ensure that your wireless interface is active and in the UP state. **DHushCP** will automatically detect and prompt you to select the active interface if multiple are detected.

4. **Run the Scripts:** Both Initiator and Responder scripts require root privileges to send and sniff DHCP packets. You can run the scripts using `sudo`:

**Responder:**
```
   cd ~/dhushcpn
   sudo .dhushcpn/bin/python DHushCP-n/dhushcp-n/responder.py --id DHUSHCP_ID
```

**Initiator:**
```
   cd ~/dhushcpn
   sudo .dhushcpn/bin/python DHushCP-n/dhushcp-n/initiator.py --id DHUSHCP_ID
```

Follow the on-screen prompts on the **Initiator** to initiate and manage the communication session. Make sure the **Responder** is already listening.

## 🔄 Communication Flow (DHushCP-n specific features highlighted)

1. **Initial Exchange:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Generates a unique session ID.
     - Detects and selects the active wireless interface.
     - Generates an ECC key pair (private/public keys).
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID (option 224), and session ID (option 225) into the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet and waits for the Responder's public key.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Listens for DHCP Discover packets with option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID.
     - Upon receiving a valid DHCP Discover (option 224 set to DHUSHCP_ID), extracts the session ID from option 225.
     - Extracts and reassembles the Initiator's public ECC key from the correct DHCP option.
     - Generates its own ECC key pair.
     - Embeds its public key, the DHUSHCP_ID, and the extracted session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover and waits for Initiator's message.

2. **Message Transmission:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the Responder's public key from the DHCP Discover packet.
     - Derives the shared AES key using its private ECC key and the Responder's public ECC key.
     - Prompts the user to input a message to send to the Responder.
     - **Embeds the secret message into an 8-character cover-text (`"Hey bro!"`) using zero-width characters.**
![ini](docs/ini.png)
     - Encrypts the **stego message** using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and adds a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted message with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted message.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet from the Initiator.
     - Extracts and decrypts the message using the shared AES key.
     - **Decodes the stego message to retrieve the original secret message.**
     - Displays the decrypted message to the Responder user.
     - Prompts the Responder user to input a reply message.
     - **Embeds the secret reply into an 8-character cover-text (`"Wass'up?"`) using zero-width characters.**
![res](docs/res.png)
     - Encrypts the reply using the shared AES key with AES-GCM and appends a SHA-256 checksum.
     - Embeds the encrypted reply with the checksum and session ID into a new DHCP Discover packet.
     - Sends the DHCP Discover packet containing the encrypted reply.

3. **Finalization:**
   - **Initiator:**
     - Receives the encrypted DHCP Discover packet containing the Responder's reply.
     - Decrypts the reply using the shared AES key.
     - **Decodes the stego message to retrieve the original secret message and displays the reply message to the Initiator user.**
     - **The two users can now continue communicating the same way further.**
     - From the **Initiator**'s side:
![ini-cont](docs/ini-cont.png)
     - From the **Responder**'s side:
![res-cont](docs/res-cont.png)
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.
   
   - **Responder:**
     - Upon request (`Ctrl+C`), performs cleanup by deleting encryption keys, clearing system logs (syslog, auth), and resetting the terminal.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Nested Text Steganography in DHushCP-n

DHushCP-n doesn’t just hide data inside DHCP packets - it can also hide the **user’s plaintext** inside a harmless-looking message using invisible Unicode characters. This creates a “stego inside stego” design:

1. Your plaintext is hidden inside a short, innocent cover text (using zero-width characters).
2. That stego text is then encrypted with AES-GCM.
3. The encrypted bytes are embedded in DHCP option 226.

Even if someone somehow decrypts the packet, what they see is still not the real message, but just a normal-looking string with invisible characters in between.

### How the Text Stego Layer Works

With text steganography, DHushCP-n uses **zero-width Unicode characters** to encode data:

- `U+200B` – Zero Width Space
- `U+200C` – Zero Width Non-Joiner
- `U+200D` – Zero Width Joiner
- `U+2060` – Word Joiner

These characters are **invisible** when printed normally, but they are still there as real bytes in the string.

The idea is simple:

1. Take the plaintext message (what the user actually wants to send).
2. Convert it to bits (each character → 8 bits).
3. Group bits into 2-bit chunks.
4. Map each 2-bit chunk to one of four zero-width characters.
5. Interleave those zero-width characters into a visible *cover text* like `"Hey bro!"`.

The resulting string looks harmless and human-readable, but its “gaps” are full of invisible data.

### Encoding: From Plaintext to Stego Text

Let’s say the user’s real message is:

> `hi`

1. Convert characters to bytes:
   - `h` → `01101000`
   - `i` → `01101001`

2. Concatenate and split into 2-bit groups:
   - `01101000 01101001` → `01 10 10 00 01 10 10 01`

3. Map each 2-bit group to a zero-width character, for example:
   - `01` → `U+200C` (Zero Width Non-Joiner)
   - `10` → `U+200D` (Zero Width Joiner)
   - `00` → `U+200B` (Zero Width Space)
   - `11` → `U+2060` (Word Joiner)

4. Take a cover text such as:

   `Hey bro!`

   and insert the zero-width characters between its visible characters:

   - After `H`, insert 1st zero-width character
   - After `e`, insert 2nd
   - After `y`, insert 3rd
   - and so on, appending any leftover zero-width chars at the end.

To a human (and most tools), the result still looks like:

> `Hey bro!`

But in reality the string is more like:

> `H[ZW]e[ZW]y[ZW] [ZW]b[ZW]r[ZW]o[ZW]![ZW]`

where `[ZW]` are invisible zero-width characters carrying the encoded bits of `"hi"`.

### Decoding: From Stego Text Back to Plaintext

On the receiving side, the process is reversed:

1. Scan the received text and **extract only the zero-width characters**.
2. Convert each zero-width character back into its corresponding 2-bit pattern.
3. Reassemble the 2-bit chunks into full bytes (groups of 8 bits).
4. Convert each byte back to an ASCII character.

By doing this, the original plaintext string (e.g. `"hi"`) is recovered in full.

The visible cover text is effectively just camouflage; the real payload is sitting in those invisible gaps.

### Why This Limits the Maximum Message Length

Each plaintext character:

- is 8 bits,
- which becomes 4 chunks of 2 bits,
- which become 4 zero-width characters,
- which are inserted into (or appended to) the cover text.

This makes the **stego string longer than the original plaintext**. That stego string is then encrypted with AES-GCM and placed into DHCP option 226, which has a strict maximum size of **255 bytes**.

Because the encrypted data must include:

- nonce (12 bytes),
- ciphertext (which scales with message length),
- checksum (32 bytes),

there’s a hard upper bound on how long the stego text - and therefore the original plaintext - can be.

In practice, this means:

- **Longer plaintext → more zero-width chars → bigger stego text → larger encrypted payload.**
- At some point, the payload would exceed the 255-byte DHCP option limit, so DHushCP-n enforces a maximum message length.

### Why Use Text Stego at All?

Even though AES-GCM already encrypts the message, text steganography adds:

- **Plausible deniability**  
  Someone who decrypts the payload still sees only a normal-looking short phrase, not an obvious secret message.

- **Nested steganography**  
  The data is hidden first at the **text** level (zero-width characters), then inside the **network** level (DHCP option 226). You’re hiding a secret inside another secret.

- **Protection from prying eyes**  
  DHushCP-n hides the real message inside harmless-looking text using invisible characters, in case someone is looking over your shoulder when the message is being decrypted.

In short: encryption protects **confidentiality**, while text steganography improves **stealth**.

⚠️ **DISCLAIMER**: Full transparency - since I am not an expert in cryptography, I used various public online resources as well as AI to find a proper solution and implementation for this aspect of DHushCP.
