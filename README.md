## 🔍 **Overview**
This is a summary of my ongoing **Network Steganography** projects. 

## 🛠️ **Projects**
- 🔐 **Steganography:**<br />
  - **hARP** - Network steganography tool for covert communication via spoofed ARP caches and SSH. Based on the **Active Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops** concept.
    - *Project available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/hARP).*<br />
  - **HM-Nmap** - Covert communication using messages encoded in open ports and decoded via nmap. Based on the **Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops** concept.
    - *Project available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/hm-nmap).*<br />
  - **DHushCP** - Covert communication tool that uses the **DHCP protocol** to enable secure and hidden message transmission; optionally, it uses **nested steganography** by embedding zero-width text.
    - *Project available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/DHushCP).*<br />
  - **SShiD** - Covert communication tool that uses **Wi-Fi beacons** and Vendor-Specific Information Elements (IEs) to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. 
    - *Project available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/SShiD).*<br />

- 🌱 **Work in progress - DHcw:**<br />  
  - **Dimension-hopping** (moving target) steganography.
  - **Chaffing** and **winnowing** of data transmission.
  - *Not public yet. Currently still in the design phase.*
