## 🔍 **Overview**
This is a repository containing the documentation of each of my ongoing **Network Steganography** projects. Note that the code is not included here, since it's going to be part of a comprehensive course I'm creating for a client under a full exclusivity agreement. However, most details about the functionality of each application are provided via the README files inside this repo.

## 🛠️ **Projects**
- :telescope: **Steganography:**<br />
  - **hARP** - Network steganography tool for covert communication via spoofed ARP caches and SSH. Active Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops<br />
  - **hm-nmap** - Covert communication using messages encoded in open ports and decoded via nmap. Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops.<br />
  - **DHushCP** - Covert communication tool that uses the DHCP protocol to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines.<br />
  - **DHushCP-n** - Based on DHushCP, uses nested Network Steganography by embedding zero-width text stego into network steganography techniques.<br />
  - **SShiD** - Covert communication tool that uses Wi-Fi beacons to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines.<br />

- :telescope: **Planned 2026:**<br />
  - Packet-hopping covert communication.
  - Protocol-hopping covert communication.
  - Blockchain TX-based covert communication.
