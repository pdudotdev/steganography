## 🔍 **Overview**
This is a repository containing the documentation of each of my ongoing **Network Steganography** projects. Note that the code is not included here (except for the **hARP** project), since it's going to be part of a comprehensive course I'm creating for a client under a full exclusivity agreement. However, most details about the functionality of each application are provided via the **README** files inside this repository - see the links below.

## 🛠️ **Projects**
- 🔐 **Steganography Applications:**<br />
  - **hARP** - Network steganography tool for covert communication via spoofed ARP caches and SSH. Based on the *Active Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops* concept. Full **code** available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/hARP). **Article** available [**here**](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/network-steganography-part-i-covert-communication-via-teodosiu-5aytf/).<br />
  - **HM-Nmap** - Covert communication using messages encoded in open ports and decoded via nmap. Based on the *Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops* concept. Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/2.%20hm-nmap/README.md).<br />
  - **DHushCP** - Covert communication tool that uses the **DHCP protocol** to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/3.%20DHushCP/README.md).<br />
  - **DHushCP-n** - Based on DHushCP, uses **nested** Network Steganography by embedding zero-width text stego into network steganography techniques. Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/4.%20DHushCP-n/README.md).<br />
  - **SShiD** - Covert communication tool that uses **Wi-Fi beacons** to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/5.%20SShiD/README.md).<br />

- 🎯 **Planned for 2026:**<br />
  - **Packet-hopping** covert communication.
  - **Protocol-hopping** covert communication.
  - **Blockchain TX-based** covert communication.
