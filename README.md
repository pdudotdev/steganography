## 🔍 **Overview**
This is a repository containing the documentation of each of my ongoing **Network Steganography** projects. 

⛔ Note: Due to the sensitive nature of these applications - stealthy communication methods and data exfiltration capabilities - the code sits in private repos and can be made available only under certain conditions, e.g., during a technical interview.

However, most high-level details about the functionality of each application are provided via the **README** files inside this repository - see the links below.

## 🛠️ **Projects**
- 🔐 **Steganography projects:**<br />
  - **hARP** - Network steganography tool for covert communication via spoofed ARP caches and SSH. Based on the **Active Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops** concept.
    - *Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/1.%20hARP/README.md).*<br />
  - **HM-Nmap** - Covert communication using messages encoded in open ports and decoded via nmap. Based on the **Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops** concept.
    - *Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/2.%20hm-nmap/README.md).*<br />
  - **DHushCP** - Covert communication tool that uses the **DHCP protocol** to enable secure and hidden message transmission; optionally, it uses **nested steganography** by embedding zero-width text.
    - *Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/3.%20DHushCP/README.md).*<br />
  - **SShiD** - Covert communication tool that uses **Wi-Fi beacons** and Vendor-Specific Information Elements (IEs) to enable secure and hidden message exchange between two machines. 
    - *Details available [**here**](https://github.com/pdudotdev/steganography/blob/main/4.%20SShiD/README.md).*<br />

- ✍️ **Work in progress - QUICJ**: 
  - Project involving the following steganographic techniques:
    - **Covert timing channels** and **jitter modulation**.
    - **Chaffing** and **winnowing** of data transmission.

- 🌱 **In the stego apps pipeline:**<br />  
  - **Packet-hopping** and **protocol-hopping** covert communication.
