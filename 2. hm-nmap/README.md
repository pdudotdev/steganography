**HM-Nmap** is a Python-based tool for Linux that enables stealthy communication between two parties by encoding messages into open TCP ports. The **encoder** script converts a plaintext message into a series of open ports, while the **decoder** scans these ports using **nmap** to reconstruct the original message. This technique leverages port scanning capabilities and is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional communication channels are monitored or restricted.

🍀 **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

## 🎯 Advantages

- **Easy to Use**: Host 1 (the **Encoder**) encodes a covert message by opening certain ports.
- **Stealthy**: Host 2 (the **Decoder**) utilizes **nmap** port scanning to decode the hidden message.
- **No Additional Dependencies**: Relies on standard Python libraries and `nmap`, which is freely available.
- **Secure**: Needs a pre-shared password (token) and only allows communication with the intended host. 
- **Messaging**: Supports messages up to 100 characters. Limit may increase in future versions.

## 🛠️ How It Works

### Encoder (Host Writing the Message)

1. **Message Input**: The user inputs a plaintext message (up to 100 characters).
2. **Port Encoding**:
   - Each character in the message is converted to its ASCII value.
   - A unique port number is calculated using the formula:
     ```
     port = base_port + (position_in_message * 256) + ASCII_value
     ```
   - This ensures that even repeated characters map to different ports based on their position.
3. **Opening Ports**:
   - The encoder asynchronously opens the calculated ports on the host machine.
   - The user can manually check if ports have been opened using `netstat -nlpt`.
   - A control server listens on a predefined port for shutdown signals from the other host.
4. **Ready Signal**:
   - After opening all ports, the encoder sends a "ready" signal to the decoder, indicating that the message is ready to be read.

### Decoder (Host Reading the Message)

1. **Listening for Ready Signal**:
   - The decoder listens on a specific port for the "ready" signal from the encoder.
   - Upon receiving the signal and validating the shared secret token, it proceeds to scan ports on the encoder using **nmap**.
2. **Port Scanning**:
   - Scans the encoder's IP address over the calculated port range.
   - Collects all open ports and sorts them.
3. **Message Decoding**:
   - Reconstructs the original message by:
     - Calculating the position and ASCII value from each port number.
     - Sorting characters based on their position.
     - Concatenating characters to form the message.
4. **Shutdown Signal**:
   - Optionally sends a shutdown signal back to the encoder to trigger cleanup.

### Cleanup Process

- **Trigger**: Initiated when the decoder sends a shutdown signal after successfully decoding the message.
- **Function**:
  - The encoder receives the signal and gracefully closes all opened ports.
  - Stops the control server and terminates the encoder script.
- **Purpose**:
  - Ensures that no unnecessary ports remain open, maintaining system security.
  - Confirms to the encoder that the message was successfully received and decoded.

## 🎓 Example: Encoding and Decoding

Let's walk through an example of how **HM-Nmap** encodes and decodes the message `"hello, world!"`.

### 📝 Encoding the Message

1. **Run the Encoder Script**

   ```
   python3 encoder.py <decoder_ip> <shared_token>
   ```

   - **`<decoder_ip>`**: IP address of the decoder machine.
   - **`<shared_token>`**: Pre-shared secret token for authentication.

2. **Input the Message**
```
[INPUT] Enter the message to encode (max 100 characters): hello, world!
```

3. **Port Calculation**

Each character in the message is converted to its ASCII value and mapped to a unique port number using the formula:
```
port = base_port + (position_in_message * 256) + ASCII_value
```
   - **`base_port`**: 10000
   - **`position_in_message`**: Zero-based index of the character in the message.
   - **`ASCII_value`**: ASCII code of the character.

| Position | Character | ASCII Value | Port Calculation                         | Port Number |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 0        | h         | 104         | 10000 + (0 * 256) + 104 = 10104          | 10104       |
| 1        | e         | 101         | 10000 + (1 * 256) + 101 = 10357          | 10357       |
| 2        | l         | 108         | 10000 + (2 * 256) + 108 = 10620          | 10620       |
| 3        | l         | 108         | 10000 + (3 * 256) + 108 = 10876          | 10876       |
| 4        | o         | 111         | 10000 + (4 * 256) + 111 = 11135          | 11135       |
| 5        | ,         | 44          | 10000 + (5 * 256) + 44 = 11224           | 11224       |
| 6        |           | 32          | 10000 + (6 * 256) + 32 = 11568           | 11568       |
| 7        | w         | 119         | 10000 + (7 * 256) + 119 = 11911          | 11911       |
| 8        | o         | 111         | 10000 + (8 * 256) + 111 = 12159          | 12159       |
| 9        | r         | 114         | 10000 + (9 * 256) + 114 = 12318          | 12318       |
| 10       | l         | 108         | 10000 + (10 * 256) + 108 = 12668         | 12668       |
| 11       | d         | 100         | 10000 + (11 * 256) + 100 = 12916         | 12916       |
| 12       | !         | 33          | 10000 + (12 * 256) + 33 = 13105          | 13105       |

4. **Encoder Output**

The encoder attempts to open each calculated port and sends a ready signal to the decoder.

```
[INFO] Attempting to open ports.
[INFO] Control server is listening on port 9000
[INFO] Ready signal sent to the decoder.
[INFO] Port 10104 is open.
[INFO] Port 10357 is open.
[INFO] Port 10620 is open.
[INFO] Port 10876 is open.
[INFO] Port 11135 is open.
[INFO] Port 11224 is open.
[INFO] Port 11568 is open.
[INFO] Port 11911 is open.
[INFO] Port 12159 is open.
[INFO] Port 12318 is open.
[INFO] Port 12668 is open.
[INFO] Port 12916 is open.
[INFO] Port 13105 is open.
```

### 🔍 Decoding the Message

1. **Run the Decoder Script**

```
python3 decoder.py <encoder_ip> <shared_token>
```

- **`<encoder_ip>`**: IP address of the encoder machine.
- **`<shared_token>`**: Pre-shared secret token matching the encoder's.

2. **Decoder Output**

The decoder listens for the ready signal, scans the specified port range, and decodes the message.

```
[INFO] Listening for 'ready' signal on port 9001...
[INFO] Received valid 'ready' signal from the encoder.
[INFO] Scanning <encoder_ip> for open ports in range 10000-65535...
[INFO] Open ports: [10104, 10357, 10620, 10876, 11135, 11224, 11568, 11911, 12159, 12318, 12668, 12916, 13105]
[MESSAGE DECODED] Encoder says: hello, world!
[INPUT] Do you want to confirm receipt to the encoder? y is recommended (y/n): y
[INFO] Shutdown signal sent to the encoder.
```

3. **Decoding the Ports**

Each open port is mapped back to its corresponding character using the formula:
```
character = chr((port - base_port) % 256)
```

| Port Number | Calculation                     | Character |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 10104       | (10104 - 10000) % 256 = 104     | h         |
| 10357       | (10357 - 10000) % 256 = 101     | e         |
| 10620       | (10620 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 10876       | (10876 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 11135       | (11135 - 10000) % 256 = 111     | o         |
| 11224       | (11224 - 10000) % 256 = 44      | ,         |
| 11568       | (11568 - 10000) % 256 = 32      |           |
| 11911       | (11911 - 10000) % 256 = 119     | w         |
| 12159       | (12159 - 10000) % 256 = 111     | o         |
| 12318       | (12318 - 10000) % 256 = 114     | r         |
| 12668       | (12668 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 12916       | (12916 - 10000) % 256 = 100     | d         |
| 13105       | (13105 - 10000) % 256 = 33      | !         |

4. **Encoder Side After Shutdown**

Upon receiving the shutdown signal, the encoder cleans up by closing all opened ports.

```
The message was read by the other party.
Cleaning up ports by shutting them down.
All ports have been closed.
```

## ⛑️ Security Considerations
- **Administrative Privileges**: **HM-Nmap** requires **sudo** privileges, so ensure that only trusted users have access to the scripts.
- **Network Impact**: Manipulating open ports can have unintended consequences on network operations. Use **HM-Nmap** in controlled environments.
- **Pre-shared Token**: Be cautious with token sharing. Always share the secret password through a separate secure channel.
- **Closing Ports**: Closing ports may violate organizational policies. Ensure compliance before using **HM-Nmap**.

## 🎯 Planned Upgrades
- [x] Improved CLI experience
- [ ] More testing is needed

## 🙏 Special Thank You
The idea behind creating **HM-Nmap** was inspired by the concept of **Network Dead Drops** pioneered by Tobias Schmidbauer, Steffen Wendzel, Aleksandra Mileva and Wojciech Mazurczyk in **Introducing Dead Drops to Network Steganography using ARP-Caches and SNMP-Walks** (more details [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3339252.3341488)).

Main differences between the original approach and **HM-Nmap**:
- **HM-Nmap** introduces a new flavor of **Network Dead Drops**, named **Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops**.
- **Passive** because no active connection is established. **Self-Hosted** because the encoder stores the hidden message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** does not use an unaware 3rd party to store hidden messages.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** uses a completely different method for storing the message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** the receiver (decoder) scans the encoder to get the message.
- **HM-Nmap** does not involve a 3rd party for the dead drop which may raise suspicions or be illegal. Also reduces complexity.
- Other differences in nuances of the overall logic and communication flow, as well as of the actual code implementation.
