# 🕵️‍♂️ HM-Nmap: Covert Communication via Port Manipulation 🕵️‍♂️

![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.8%2B-blue.svg)
[![Stable Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/version-0.1.0-blue.svg)](https://github.com/pdudotdev/hm-nmap/releases/tag/v0.1.0)

**HM-Nmap** is a Python-based tool for Linux that enables stealthy communication between two parties by encoding messages into open TCP ports. The **encoder** script converts a plaintext message into a series of open ports, while the **decoder** scans these ports using **nmap** to reconstruct the original message. This technique leverages port scanning capabilities and is particularly useful in scenarios where traditional communication channels are monitored or restricted.

🍀 **NOTE:** This is an ongoing **research project** for educational purposes rather than a full-fledged production-ready tool, so treat it accordingly.

⚠️ **NOTE:** The code is currently maintained in a private repository and will be included in upcoming educational materials. Available upon request, in certain conditions such as technical presentation or interviews.

## 🎯 Advantages

- **Easy to Use**: Host 1 (the **Encoder**) encodes a covert message by opening certain ports.
- **Stealthy**: Host 2 (the **Decoder**) utilizes **nmap** port scanning to decode the hidden message.
- **No Additional Dependencies**: Relies on standard Python libraries and `nmap`, which is freely available.
- **Secure**: Needs a pre-shared password (token), thus only allowing communication with the intended host. 
- **Messaging**: Supports messages up to 100 characters. Limit may increase in future versions.

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- `python-nmap` and `nmap` installed on the decoder machine

### Steps

1. **Prepare the Environment (both hosts)**
```bash
mkdir hm-nmap
cd hm-nmap
python3 -m venv .hmnmap
source .hmnmap/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/pdudotdev/hm-nmap.git
```

2. **Install Python-Nmap (Decoder host only)**
```bash
pip install python-nmap
```

3. **Install Nmap (Decoder host only)**
```bash
sudo apt install nmap
```

## 🛠️ How It Works

- **Important**: Make sure the **Decoder** is running and listening *before* executing the **Encoder** script on the other host.
- **Testing**: **HM-Nmap** has been (and is) currently tested only with **Kali Linux**. Other distros such as **Ubuntu** should be fine, too.

Let's walk through an example of how **HM-Nmap** encodes and decodes the secret message `"hello, world!"`.
- **Encoder IP**: `192.168.56.122`
- **Decoder IP**: `192.168.56.123`
- **Shared Token**: `our_password`

1. 🎯 **Run the Decoder Script**

```
cd ~/hm-nmap
sudo .hmnmap/bin/python hm-nmap/hm-nmap/decoder.py 192.168.56.122 our_password
```

- **`<encoder_ip>`**: IP address of the encoder machine.
- **`<shared_token>`**: Pre-shared secret token for authentication.

![1-1](docs/1-1.png)

2. 🎯 **Run the Encoder Script**

```
cd ~/hm-nmap
sudo .hmnmap/bin/python hm-nmap/hm-nmap/encoder.py 192.168.56.123 our_password
```

   - **`<decoder_ip>`**: IP address of the decoder machine.
   - **`<shared_token>`**: Pre-shared secret token for authentication.

3. 🎯 **Input the Message**
```
[INPUT] Enter the message to encode (max 100 characters): hello, world!
```

4. 🎯 **Port Calculation**

Each character in the message is converted to its ASCII value and mapped to a unique port number using the formula:
```
port = base_port + (position_in_message * 256) + ASCII_value
```
   - **`base_port`**: 10000
   - **`position_in_message`**: Zero-based index of the character in the message.
   - **`ASCII_value`**: ASCII code of the character.

| Position | Character | ASCII Value | Port Calculation                         | Port Number |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------------------------------------------|-------------|
| 0        | h         | 104         | 10000 + (0 * 256) + 104 = 10104          | 10104       |
| 1        | e         | 101         | 10000 + (1 * 256) + 101 = 10357          | 10357       |
| 2        | l         | 108         | 10000 + (2 * 256) + 108 = 10620          | 10620       |
| 3        | l         | 108         | 10000 + (3 * 256) + 108 = 10876          | 10876       |
| 4        | o         | 111         | 10000 + (4 * 256) + 111 = 11135          | 11135       |
| 5        | ,         | 44          | 10000 + (5 * 256) + 44 = 11324           | 11324       |
| 6        |           | 32          | 10000 + (6 * 256) + 32 = 11568           | 11568       |
| 7        | w         | 119         | 10000 + (7 * 256) + 119 = 11911          | 11911       |
| 8        | o         | 111         | 10000 + (8 * 256) + 111 = 12159          | 12159       |
| 9        | r         | 114         | 10000 + (9 * 256) + 114 = 12418          | 12418       |
| 10       | l         | 108         | 10000 + (10 * 256) + 108 = 12668         | 12668       |
| 11       | d         | 100         | 10000 + (11 * 256) + 100 = 12916         | 12916       |
| 12       | !         | 33          | 10000 + (12 * 256) + 33 = 13105          | 13105       |

5. 🎯 **Checking Open Ports**

All the necessary ports have been opened on the Encoder machine.

![1-2](docs/1-2.png)

6. 🎯 **Encoder Ready**

The encoder sends a "ready" signal to the decoder's TCP port 9001, whilst also listening on its own port 9000 for a message receipt from the decoder.

```
[INFO] Attempting to open ports.
[INFO] Control server is listening on port 9000
[INFO] Ready signal sent to the decoder.
```

7. 🎯 **`Message Is Ready` Signal**

The decoder listens for the ready signal from the encoder and gets it - port 9001.

```
[INFO] Listening for 'ready' signal on port 9001...
[INFO] Received valid 'ready' signal from the encoder.
[INFO] Scanning <encoder_ip> for open ports in range 10000-65535...
```

![1-3](docs/1-3.png)

8. 🎯 **Scanning Encoder's Ports via NMAP**

The decoder immediately starts scanning the encoder's open ports in the specified range.

```
[INFO] Scanning 192.168.56.122 for open ports in range 10000-65295...
```

![1-4](docs/1-4.png)

9. 🎯 **Decoding the Ports**

Each open port is mapped back to its corresponding character using the formula:
```
character = chr((port - base_port) % 256)
```

| Port Number | Calculation                     | Character |
|-------------|---------------------------------|-----------|
| 10104       | (10104 - 10000) % 256 = 104     | h         |
| 10357       | (10357 - 10000) % 256 = 101     | e         |
| 10620       | (10620 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 10876       | (10876 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 11135       | (11135 - 10000) % 256 = 111     | o         |
| 11324       | (11324 - 10000) % 256 = 44      | ,         |
| 11568       | (11568 - 10000) % 256 = 32      |           |
| 11911       | (11911 - 10000) % 256 = 119     | w         |
| 12159       | (12159 - 10000) % 256 = 111     | o         |
| 12418       | (12418 - 10000) % 256 = 114     | r         |
| 12668       | (12668 - 10000) % 256 = 108     | l         |
| 12916       | (12916 - 10000) % 256 = 100     | d         |
| 13105       | (13105 - 10000) % 256 = 33      | !         |

The message is then displayed to the user:
```
[MESSAGE DECODED] Encoder says: hello, world!
```

10. 🎯 **Message Confirmation**

Decoder then asks the user to confirm message receipt to the encoder.
```
[INPUT] Do you want to confirm receipt to the encoder? y is recommended (y/n):
```

11. 🎯 **Shutdown Signal**

After the user enters `y` at the prompt, the TCP shutdown signal is sent to the encoder's port 9000.
```
[INPUT] Do you want to confirm receipt to the encoder? y is recommended (y/n): y
[INFO] Shutdown signal sent to the encoder.
```

![1-5](docs/1-5.png)

12. 🎯 **Encoder Side After Shutdown**

Upon receiving the shutdown signal, the encoder cleans up by closing all opened ports.

```
The message was read by the other party.
Cleaning up ports by shutting them down.
All ports have been closed.
```

## ⛑️ Security Considerations
- **Administrative Privileges**: **HM-Nmap** requires **sudo** privileges, so ensure that only trusted users have access to the scripts.
- **Network Impact**: Manipulating open ports can have unintended consequences on network operations. Use **HM-Nmap** in controlled environments.
- **Pre-shared Token**: Be cautious with token sharing. Always share the secret password through a separate secure channel.
- **Closing Ports**: Closing ports may violate organizational policies. Ensure compliance before using **HM-Nmap**.

## 🚀 Planned Upgrades
- [x] Improved CLI experience
- [ ] Increased message length
- [ ] More testing is needed

## 🙏 Special Thank You
The idea behind creating **HM-Nmap** was inspired by the concept of **Network Dead Drops** pioneered by Tobias Schmidbauer, Steffen Wendzel, Aleksandra Mileva and Wojciech Mazurczyk in **Introducing Dead Drops to Network Steganography using ARP-Caches and SNMP-Walks** (more details [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3339252.3341488)).

Main differences between the original approach and **HM-Nmap**:
- **HM-Nmap** introduces a new flavor of **Network Dead Drops**, named **Passive Self-Hosted Network Dead Drops**.
- **Passive** because no active connection is established. **Self-Hosted** because the encoder stores the hidden message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** does not use an unaware 3rd party to store hidden messages.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** uses a completely different method for storing the message.
- Unlike the original **Network Dead Drops** concept, **HM-Nmap** the receiver (decoder) scans the encoder to get the message.
- **HM-Nmap** does not involve a 3rd party for the dead drop which may raise suspicions or be illegal. Also reduces complexity.
- Other differences in nuances of the overall logic and communication flow, as well as of the actual code implementation.
